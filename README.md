# Open Core Protocol

The Open Core Protocolâ„¢ (OCP) defines a high-performance, bus-independent interface between IP cores. Defines a point-to-point interface between two communicating entities.

### OCP protocol main features
1) One entity acts as the master of the OCP instance, and the other as the slave.
2) Only the master can present commands and is the controlling entity.
3) The slave responds to commands presented to it, either by accepting data from the master, or presenting data to the master.
